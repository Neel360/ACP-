    <p><b>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs, that computers can
    follow to perform tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of
    procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming
    languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
    processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of
    the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal
    logic.</b>
